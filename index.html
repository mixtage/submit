		<p>MIXTAGE is open for submissions for our second issue: FERVOUR</p>
		<p><i>What was something that was too hot to touch, but you did anyway? Who made you feel like every limb on your body was on fire? How do you feel when you're lost in the haze of it all? What did you let smolder when you should have blew it out? When was the last time you burned yourself playing with fire? And of course, what are your favorite spicy recipes?</i> </p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p><b>GENERAL GUIDELINES:</b></p>
		<p>1. We do not accept previously published work unless it was published on a personal website/blog/newsletter.</p>
		<p>2. You are welcome to reprint work that is published in Mixtage, as long as you credit us as the first publisher.</p>
		<p>3. We reserve the right to take down any work from any contributor that we later find have committed plagiarism, or have engaged in harmful and abusive statements.</p>
		<p>4. Simultaneous submissions are perfectly fine, just let us know ASAP if you get accepted elsewhere.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Our submissions are open to all, however we especially want to publish marginalized creators. There is an optional section on each form if you would like to self-identify.</p>
		<br>
		<p><b>Format:</b> For written pieces, if you donâ€™t want us to change the format of your piece (background colour, font colour, font, layout) please let us know in the Notes section of the Google Form. We are a visual oriented magazine, so we aim to make a few written pieces also a visual piece of art (for shorter pieces at least), <i>in collaboration with you and the editor</i>. Changes will not be made without your approval. For an example of what we mean, please check out our previous issue.</p>
		<p><b>Length:</b> 5-400 words for written pieces (excluding recipes). Please include the word length at the beginning of your piece.</p>
		<p><b>Timeline:</b> We will respond within a month. Most likely, we will respond much earlier, but if you haven't heard from us after a month, please reach out!</p>
		<br>
		<p><b>SUBMIT</b> through Google Forms in your appropriate category:</p>
